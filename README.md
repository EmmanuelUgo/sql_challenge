# Danny Ma's 8 weeks of SQL Challenge

This repository contains my attempt at solving the case studies in the 8 weeks SQL Challenge put together by @DataWithDanny. My goal here is to boost my confidence in SQL by applying what i have learnt so far on real life examples.

The Case studies contain datasets from the following domains:
- Health analytics
- Marketing analytics
- People analytics
- Financial markets
- Fast moving consumer goods
- Digital marketing
